### Nei-Gojobori_Proportion
Codon-based Test of Neutrality for analysis between sequences. 
The probability of rejecting the null hypothesis of strict-neutrality (dN = dS) (below diagonal) is shown. Values of P less than 0.05 are considered significant at the 5% level and are highlighted. The test statistic (dN - dS) is shown above the diagonal. dS and dN are the numbers of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions per site, respectively. The variance of the difference was computed using the analytical method. Analyses were conducted using the Nei-Gojobori method [1]. This analysis involved 319 nucleotide sequences. All ambiguous positions were removed for each sequence pair (pairwise deletion option). There were a total of 597 positions in the final dataset. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA X [2].


### Nei-Gojobori_Proportion_Adaptation (look for positive selection)
Codon-based Test of Positive Selection for analysis between sequences. 
The probability of rejecting the null hypothesis of strict-neutrality (dN = dS) in favor of the alternative hypothesis (dN > dS) (below diagonal) is shown. Values of P less than 0.05 are considered significant at the 5% level and are highlighted. The test statistic (dN - dS) is shown above the diagonal. dS and dN are the numbers of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions per site, respectively. The variance of the difference was computed using the analytical method. Analyses were conducted using the Nei-Gojobori method [1]. This analysis involved 319 nucleotide sequences. All ambiguous positions were removed for each sequence pair (pairwise deletion option). There were a total of 597 positions in the final dataset. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA X [2].
