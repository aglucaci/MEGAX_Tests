# MEGAX_Tests

Various performance experiments with methods available in MEGA-X

Data includes an already codon-aware alignment.

Substitution Matrix Estimates follow a Uniform distribution unless otherwise noted.


## Example Analysis Options 
```
    Tree to Use                     :  Automatic (Neighbor-joining tree)
    Statistical Method              :  Maximum Likelihood
Substitution Model
    Substitutions Type              :  Nucleotide
    Model/Method                    :  Jukes-Cantor model
Rates and Patterns
    Rates among Sites               :  Gamma Distributed (G)
    No of Discrete Gamma Categories :  5
Data Subset to Use
    Gaps/Missing Data Treatment     :  Use all sites
    Select Codon Positions          :  1st,2nd,3rd,Non-Coding
    Branch Swap Filter              :  None
``` 
   
## Todo: Use a fixed tree
